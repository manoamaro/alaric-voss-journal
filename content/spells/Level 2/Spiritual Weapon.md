You create a floating, spectral force that resembles a weapon of your choice and lasts for the duration.
The force appears within range in a space of your choice, and you can immediately make one melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of the force. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 2.

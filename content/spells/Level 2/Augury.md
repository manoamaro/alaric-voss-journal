You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses the omen from the Omens table.

| **Omen**     | **For Results That Will Be...** |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Weal         | Good                            |
| Woe          | Bad                             |
| Weal and woe | Good and bad                    |
| Indifference | Neither good nor bad            |

The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results. If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

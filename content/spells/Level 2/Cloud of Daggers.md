You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot Cube centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area takes 4d4 Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the Cube or ends its turn there or if the Cube moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn. On your later turns, you can take a Magic action to teleport the Cube up to 30 feet.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 2d4 for each spell slot level above 2.

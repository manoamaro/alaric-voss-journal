**Weather Sensor.** You create a Tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
**Bloom.** You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
**Sensory Effect.** You create a harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, spectral dancing fairies, a gentle breeze, the sound of an animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot Cube.
**Fire Play.** You light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a campfire.

You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or an object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 Fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell starts burning if it isn't being worn or carried.
**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10)

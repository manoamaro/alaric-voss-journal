You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 Hit Points or fewer, it has the Stunned condition. Otherwise, its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn.
The Stunned target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.

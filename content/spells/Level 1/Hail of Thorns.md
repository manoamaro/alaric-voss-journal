As you hit the creature, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your Ranged weapon or ammunition. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 1.

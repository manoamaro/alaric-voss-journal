Objects in a 20-foot Cube within range are outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the Cube is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed Dim Light in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the Invisible condition.
Attack rolls against an affected creature or object have Advantage if the attacker can see it.

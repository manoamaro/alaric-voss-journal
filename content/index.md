# Alaric Voss' Journal

> "In the gloaming between one heartbeat and the next, the Mists remember everything. I intend to do the same."

This vault is Alaric’s personal ledger — equal parts research notes, battlefield recollections, and the quiet confessions of a human wizard determined to out-think a timeless tyrant. Every entry is written with the meticulous care of an academic who now measures days by torchlight and the scrape of fangs at the door.
## Intent and Tone

- **Scholarship:** Field sketches, sigil studies, and spellwork refinements meant to keep the mind sharp even when hope feels frayed.
- **Chronicle:** Reflections on each encounter, preserving the voices of companions and the lessons wrung from Barovia’s tragedies.
- **Oath:** A reminder that this record exists so the darkness cannot rewrite the story in its own image.
## Guidance for the Reader

1. Treat every page as a living artifact. Margin notes, revisions, and errant ink blots reveal how Alaric adapts to the Count’s machinations.
2. When the prose shifts from calm analysis to raw emotion, read closely; that inflection marks moments when survival hinged on instinct.
3. Return often. The journal is updated whenever the Mists part long enough for ink to dry.

May these pages steady any traveler who dares to walk the same cursed roads.

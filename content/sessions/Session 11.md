A lone raven stood motionless on the road, about a hundred feet ahead of the party. Alaric, Van, and Orianna advanced cautiously, stopping within thirty feet. Extending his focus, Alaric cast Detect Magic—a faint gray aura shimmered around the bird, laced with threads of Transmutation. He shared his findings quietly with Orianna.

Then, without warning, a massive shape plummeted from the sky—crashing into the ground fifty feet beyond the raven. A humanoid form, towering and unnatural. Alaric’s trained eye recognized it as a construct—an arcane entity animated by magical force rather than life. Yet this one differed from any he had studied at the Neverwinter Academy. Its torso resembled a tree’s trunk wrapped in plates of bark, glowing veins pulsing beneath the surface. Its limbs were carved from ancient boughs, rooted feet gripping the earth, and broad wooden wings unfurled from its back, defying natural law. At its heart, nestled in the sacred fork of its body, pulsed a luminous core—the Crown-Core—the living heart of its magic.

The Arboran Construct began to move, slow but deliberate, reaching an outstretched wooden arm toward the immobilized raven. Its hand opened, ready to seize the creature.

From the rear, Brennick—standing about fifty feet behind—noticed a dark spiral forming above. A massive flock of ravens circled the construct, their wings blending with the mist. He tensed, drawing his sword in readiness.

Van followed suit, blade gleaming as he stepped protectively before Alaric. Orianna hesitated, torn between saving the bird or preparing for battle.

Suddenly, the raven shot into the air—not of its own will. Hugh had used Catapult, launching the creature skyward in a high arc toward Brennick. Acting on instinct, Orianna transformed into a lynx, sprinted forward, and leapt—catching the bird midair in her jaws before landing gracefully, unharmed.

The construct reacted instantly. Its wooden form groaned as it turned toward the druid. The sky erupted in motion as two flocks of ravens dove to attack.

# Encounter begins

Initiative Order: Construct, Orianna, Hugh, Van, Alaric, Ireena, Flock 1, Flock 2, Brennick.

The battle began. The construct advanced toward Van, the closest target.

Orianna reverted to her human form, still clutching the rescued raven, and struck at one of the flocks—killing a single bird.

Hugh unleashed Magic Missile at the construct, the glowing bolts splintering bark and sap but dealing little harm.

Van countered with a heavy sword strike, his blade biting deep into the creature’s wooden body.

Alaric followed with Magic Missile—three bolts of force (2, 3, 3)—barely chipping its form.

Ireena slashed into another flock, scattering birds.

Brennick hurled a firebomb, engulfing several ravens in flame.

With a thunderous crack, the construct rose into the air. Its massive wooden wings beat against the mist, lifting it beyond reach. It hurled a spike toward Van, but Alaric intervened, twisting fate itself—using his Portent to alter the outcome and spare his ally some harm. The second spike struck true, piercing Van’s shoulder.

Orianna moved to heal him with a soft incantation.

Hugh turned his focus skyward, finishing off one of the flocks with a volley of magical energy.

Van swung upward at the flying construct, missing by inches.

Alaric cast Fire Bolt—his aim true. The flame struck the creature, charring its bark (Attack 17, Damage 2).

Ireena continued cutting through the remaining birds.

Brennick threw another firebomb at the construct but missed as it hovered overhead.

Drifting closer, the construct loomed directly above Hugh and Orianna. It extended both arms, launching twin spikes that struck Orianna, wounding her badly. She retaliated by casting Web, attempting to drag it down, but the spell failed to hold.

Then Hugh raised his hand, his focus sharp, and unleashed Scorching Ray. Streams of fire streaked through the air, slamming into the Arboran Construct. Flames consumed its bark as it fell from the sky, crashing lifelessly to the ground. The battle was over.

# Aftermath

Van and Alaric approached the fallen construct. Van noticed its clawed hands—each talon forged from silver—and considered harvesting them before turning his attention to Orianna’s condition.

Alaric lingered beside the body, feeling the lingering pulse of arcane energy. He placed his hand upon the head, sensing immense power emanating from within the Crown-Core. Drawing his dagger, he began carving through the hardened wood, the effort brutal and costly. Splinters tore his flesh, blood mixing with sap as he cut deeper (–9 HP). Finally, he reached the heart of the construct—a black, pulsing mass. With trembling hands, he extracted it and stored it carefully in his pouch.

Orianna, now steady, freed the raven from its bindings and healed it fully. Yet when it tried to flee, she held it firm. The creature cawed unnaturally, its sounds hollow—more mimicry than voice. When questioned, it refused to speak. Only after Hugh threatened it did the raven’s tone shift, pleading in fear.

“Please… don’t kill me.”

A lone raven stood motionless on the road, about a hundred feet ahead of the party. [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]], [[compendium/characters/Van]], and [[compendium/characters/Orianna]] advanced cautiously, stopping within thirty feet. Extending his focus, [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] cast [[spells/Level 1/Detect Magic\|Detect Magic]]—a faint gray aura shimmered around the bird, laced with threads of Transmutation. He shared his findings quietly with [[compendium/characters/Orianna]].

Then, without warning, a massive shape plummeted from the sky—crashing into the ground fifty feet beyond the raven. A humanoid form, towering and unnatural. [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]]’s trained eye recognized it as a [[compendium/study notes/Arcane Constructs\|Construct]]—an arcane entity animated by magical force rather than life. Yet this one differed from any he had studied at the [[compendium/locations/Neverwinter Academy]]. Its torso resembled a tree’s trunk wrapped in plates of bark, glowing veins pulsing beneath the surface. Its limbs were carved from ancient boughs, rooted feet gripping the earth, and broad wooden wings unfurled from its back, defying natural law. At its heart, nestled in the sacred fork of its body, pulsed a luminous core—the Crown-Core—the living heart of its magic.

The Arboran Construct began to move, slow but deliberate, reaching an outstretched wooden arm toward the immobilized raven. Its hand opened, ready to seize the creature.

From the rear, [[compendium/characters/Brennick]]—standing about fifty feet behind—noticed a dark spiral forming above. A massive flock of ravens circled the construct, their wings blending with the mist. He tensed, drawing his sword in readiness.

[[compendium/characters/Van]] followed suit, blade gleaming as he stepped protectively before [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]]. [[compendium/characters/Orianna]] hesitated, torn between saving the bird or preparing for battle.

Suddenly, the raven shot into the air—not of its own will. [[compendium/characters/Hugh]] had used Catapult, launching the creature skyward in a high arc toward [[compendium/characters/Brennick]]. Acting on instinct, [[compendium/characters/Orianna]] transformed into a lynx, sprinted forward, and leapt—catching the bird midair in her jaws before landing gracefully, unharmed.

The construct reacted instantly. Its wooden form groaned as it turned toward the druid. The sky erupted in motion as two flocks of ravens dove to attack.

# Encounter begins

Initiative Order: Construct, [[compendium/characters/Orianna]], [[compendium/characters/Hugh]], [[compendium/characters/Van]], [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]], [[compendium/characters/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]], Flock 1, Flock 2, [[compendium/characters/Brennick]].

The battle began. The construct advanced toward [[compendium/characters/Van]], the closest target.

[[compendium/characters/Orianna]] reverted to her human form, still clutching the rescued raven, and struck at one of the flocks—killing a single bird.

[[compendium/characters/Hugh]] unleashed [[spells/Level 1/Magic Missile\|Magic Missile]] at the construct, the glowing bolts splintering bark and sap but dealing little harm.

[[compendium/characters/Van]] countered with a heavy sword strike, his blade biting deep into the creature’s wooden body.

[[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] followed with [[spells/Level 1/Magic Missile\|Magic Missile]]—three bolts of force (2, 3, 3)—barely chipping its form.

[[compendium/characters/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]] slashed into another flock, scattering birds.

[[compendium/characters/Brennick]] hurled a firebomb, engulfing several ravens in flame.

With a thunderous crack, the construct rose into the air. Its massive wooden wings beat against the mist, lifting it beyond reach. It hurled a spike toward [[compendium/characters/Van]], but [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] intervened, twisting fate itself—using his Portent to alter the outcome and spare his ally some harm. The second spike struck true, piercing [[compendium/characters/Van]]’s shoulder.

[[compendium/characters/Orianna]] moved to heal him with a soft incantation.

[[compendium/characters/Hugh]] turned his focus skyward, finishing off one of the flocks with a volley of magical energy.

[[compendium/characters/Van]] swung upward at the flying construct, missing by inches.

[[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] cast [[spells/Level 0/Fire Bolt\|Fire Bolt]]—his aim true. The flame struck the creature, charring its bark (Attack 17, Damage 2).

[[compendium/characters/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]] continued cutting through the remaining birds.

[[compendium/characters/Brennick]] threw another firebomb at the construct but missed as it hovered overhead.

Drifting closer, the construct loomed directly above [[compendium/characters/Hugh]] and [[compendium/characters/Orianna]]. It extended both arms, launching twin spikes that struck [[compendium/characters/Orianna]], wounding her badly. She retaliated by casting [[spells/Level 2/Web\|Web]], attempting to drag it down, but the spell failed to hold.

Then [[compendium/characters/Hugh]] raised his hand, his focus sharp, and unleashed [[spells/Level 2/Scorching Ray\|Scorching Ray]]. Streams of fire streaked through the air, slamming into the Arboran Construct. Flames consumed its bark as it fell from the sky, crashing lifelessly to the ground. The battle was over.

# Aftermath

[[compendium/characters/Van]] and [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] approached the fallen construct. [[compendium/characters/Van]] noticed its clawed hands—each talon forged from silver—and considered harvesting them before turning his attention to [[compendium/characters/Orianna]]’s condition.

[[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] lingered beside the body, feeling the lingering pulse of arcane energy. He placed his hand upon the head, sensing immense power emanating from within the Crown-Core. Drawing his dagger, he began carving through the hardened wood, the effort brutal and costly. Splinters tore his flesh, blood mixing with sap as he cut deeper (–9 HP). Finally, he reached the heart of the construct—a black, pulsing mass. With trembling hands, he extracted it and stored it carefully in his pouch.

[[compendium/characters/Orianna]], now steady, freed the raven from its bindings and healed it fully. Yet when it tried to flee, she held it firm. The creature cawed unnaturally, its sounds hollow—more mimicry than voice. When questioned, it refused to speak. Only after [[compendium/characters/Hugh]] threatened it did the raven’s tone shift, pleading in fear.

“Please… don’t kill me.”

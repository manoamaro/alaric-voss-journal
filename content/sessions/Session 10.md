Alaric wakes early in Madame Eva’s camp, restless and unsettled by the previous night’s visions. Outside his tent, Stanimir greets him again, asking about Neverwinter—a place he claims never to have heard of. Still disoriented, Alaric recounts his meeting with Madame Eva. Stanimir advises, “Then follow her words.”

After breakfast, Alaric sets off toward the crossroads, walking for several hours. There he finds the gallows—changed. Four bodies hang now where none stood before: an old man in armor smiling faintly, a second knight with silver trim and fury on his face, a blue-green tiefling woman, and a bronze dragonborn. Realizing it is another vision, Alaric approaches but collides with an invisible barrier that hurls him backward. Pain sears through him (–1 HP). When he rises, the bodies are gone.

He continues toward the Village of Barovia, sketching the gallows scene in his notebook.

Near the village gates, smoke and the scent of burning flesh fill the air. Villagers burn corpses at a bonfire, cleaning what looks like a battlefield. Spotting armed figures, Alaric discreetly casts Mage Armor (–1 spell slot) and proceeds cautiously.

The streets are mud and silent. Many homes stand abandoned. In the village square, a bright brazier burns. Nearby, four travelers hurry toward a church—the same four he saw on the gallows. He follows.

A sweet smell of pastries catches his attention from a nearby bakery. A woman named Bella offers him one. Suspicious, he refuses at first but accepts a few to examine later.

Moments later, chaos echoes from within the church. Alaric opens the doors just as a group emerges from the basement: a paladin, a fighter, a tiefling druid, and a bronze dragonborn—the figures from his vision. The paladin, Brennick, grabs Alaric by the robe, shouting, “Show your teeth!” Alaric complies, and Brennick releases him. Van, the fighter, demands his name. “I am Alaric. Madame Eva told me to find answers here.”

The dragonborn Hugh holds a corpse. Van mutters, “Another one of us, maybe. Stay close.” Inside, Alaric learns the dead man was Doru, son of Priest Donavich. After the confrontation, the group introduces themselves. Alaric notes that Ireena and Ismark—two others with them—did not appear in his vision.

Hugh asks for a pastry. Alaric warns it may not be safe, but Hugh eats it anyway. He then gives Alaric a black orb, claiming it grants visions. Alaric senses no magic and begins to cast Detect Magic, but Ven interrupts, insisting they move on. Alaric stores the orb.

At Bildrath’s Mercantile, Alaric buys a healing potion. The group plans to travel to Village Vallaki; Alaric offers to guide them, recalling the road from Stanimir’s camp. Rain begins as they travel. They rest briefly before continuing.

During the journey, Alaric overhears talk of undead and vampires. He recalls ancient texts describing their nature and confirms his suspicions about the region’s curse.

At the crossroads again, the gallows stand empty. When Van asks his interest, Alaric deflects, directing attention toward the road leading to Madame Eva’s camp.

Mist gathers thick and fast. A large shadow moves within it—a black carriage drawn by two dark horses covered by black sheets. The group halts. A servant, Escher, drives the carriage. It stops beside them. From within emerges Lord Strahd von Zarovich, tall and pale. His voice is calm yet commanding.

He notes Alaric’s unfamiliar face. “You were not announced,” he says. Strahd mocks Ireena, calling her a servant. Brennick and Van intervene, and Strahd warns them of meddling in his affairs.

He demands to see each one’s ability. Brennick’s blessed sword wounds him unexpectedly. Strahd acknowledges the weapon’s power with intrigue. When Alaric demonstrates Fire Bolt, Strahd is unimpressed. Alaric attempts Mind Spike on Escher; the spell strikes true but causes little harm. Strahd smiles faintly. “Weak, but curious.”

He returns to the carriage and departs into the mist.

The group resumes travel toward Vallaki. On the road to Madame Eva’s camp, a raven suddenly falls ahead, wrapped in green-veined growths.

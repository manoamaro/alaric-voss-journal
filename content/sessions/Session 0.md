Darkness. Mist coils through the air. [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] stands on a lonely road hemmed by towering trees. Though it is day, no sun pierces the gray clouds—only a dim light glows through the fog. An unseen force draws him onward until a vast castle rises from the mist.

In an instant, he stands within its halls. Before him, a man gazes out a tall window. Long dark hair, black cloak, motionless. [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] tries to move but cannot. His eyes shift to a mirror nearby—the man’s reflection is absent.

The scene changes. A chamber of cold brick walls, no light except a pulsing red form hovering in the air. Fear surges through him. His body locks as the presence in the room grows heavier, suffocating. Desperation takes hold—then darkness again.

[[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] wakes in his bed, breath sharp, heart racing. The fear lingers even as he recognises the safety of his home. For a brief moment, that oppressive presence seems to press against the walls before fading away. Composing himself, he decides it must be another omen—stronger than any before.

He seeks his mentor, [[compendium/characters/Archmage Kale Thandrel]], and recounts the vision. Kale listens, troubled, then warns him to forget it. “Some truths,” he says, “should remain unknown—for your sake, and for ours.”

[[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] insists. Something about this vision feels tied to fate itself. Reluctantly, Kale retrieves a hidden ritual book—its cover bare except for indecipherable arcane sigils. He instructs [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] to perform a specific ritual that may help him see deeper.

Back at his shop, [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] seals the windows and follows the ritual’s steps. The world falls away. Mist gathers at his feet. The same forest returns, the same castle. Inside the same chamber, he sees the dark figure again—but this time, the man turns. Their eyes meet. Power floods the room, crushing and immense. Then—another flash. A tent. A village name in a sign: [[compendium/locations/Village Vallaki]]. 

He wakes once more, trembling. He resumes his daily work, but the man’s face and the village’s name remain vivid in his mind.

The next day, a man visits his shop seeking a lost possession. [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] charges 5 gold pieces. The man claims he will pay later at the tavern and invites [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] for drinks. The item is described as a small round token engraved with a raven.

Using [[spells/Level 2/Detect Thoughts\|Detect Thoughts]], [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] visualises it—a coin-like object of copper—and with [[spells/Level 2/Locate Object\|Locate Object]], he discovers it lies among the man’s own belongings at the tavern. The man laughs it off as forgetfulness and repeats his invitation.

That evening, [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] meets him again. The stranger introduces himself as [[compendium/characters/Anton]] and asks, “Do you enjoy meddling in other people’s affairs?”. [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] answers no. The man smiles faintly. “Good. I’m seeking someone to help a friend—a man beloved by his village, now imprisoned for dark magic. You might be perfect for it.” Guided by beliefs and principles, rearing the words “dark magic” makes [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] reluctant, enough to be perceived by [[compendium/characters/Anton]]. But some strange curiosity glances in his mind.

When [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] presses for details, the man stands. “Better not to know. You said you don’t pry into others’ business.” He leaves.

The same strange curiosity overcomes caution. [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] casts [[spells/Level 2/Detect Thoughts\|Detect Thoughts]] once more, silent enough for others to not notice, but the man senses it immediately. “Don’t ever do that again.” His tone is cold.

Ashamed for such behaviour, [[Alaric Voss\|Alaric]] leaves the tavern. Fog begins to seep through the streets. The air grows heavy; each step drains his strength. By the time he reaches home, the mist is already inside. Exhausted, he collapses into bed.

He awakens at a crossroads. An empty gallows by the road, visible through the most, immediately attracts his eyes. He looks away, and see three wooden signs point ahead:

He recalls the name from his vision—the [[compendium/locations/Village Vallaki]] with the tent. Feeling lost, he follows that road.

Along the way, he meets another traveler named [[compendium/characters/Stanimir]], a big guy with a goatee, who recognizes his confusion and leads him to a camp. There, inside a large tent, he meets a woman named [[compendium/characters/Madame Eva]], who explains that others too have been drawn here by the mists. “You arrived earlier than expected,” she says. “Rest for now. In the morning, go to the [[compendium/locations/Village of Barovia]], maybe you will find your answers there.”

# Classification

_Artificial Sentience through Arcane Anchoring_

Constructs are nonliving entities animated by sustained magical force. Their form may be mechanical, alchemical, or sculpted from inert matter. Unlike undead, their animation does not derive from life essence but from pure arcane energy bound to form and command.

# Nature of Constructs

Constructs operate through layered enchantments, blending Abjuration, Transmutation, and Evocation.

Their consciousness—if present—is artificial: a patterned response system encoded by glyph, not true thought.

## Common varieties

- Golems: Clay, flesh, stone, or iron—driven by runic matrices.
- Animated Objects: Simpler forms animated by a single command phrase.
- Homunculi: Semi-living creations bonded to their creator’s psyche.
- Arcane Servitors / Sentinels: Magical guardians maintaining wards or laboratories.

Observation: “A construct is not alive; it is a statement written into the Weave that refuses to fade.”

# Energy Core (Heart of Motion)

At the center of every sustained construct lies an energy core—a crystallized locus where arcane energy is condensed and stabilized.

## Core Types

- Runic Core: Inscribed with command seals; channelled directly from a mage’s binding spell.
- Elemental Core: Contains a bound spirit of elemental energy (fire, air, earth). Highly unstable.
- Soul Core (forbidden): Uses a fragment of a living essence to grant adaptive logic. Considered necromancy.
- Weave-Anchor Core: Self-sustaining through resonance with ambient magic; used in advanced or ancient constructs.

The core functions as both power source and directive matrix—destroying or disrupting it deanimates the construct instantly.

# Theoretical Function

- Magical current flows from the core through etched conduits (runic channels) that replace veins or nerves.
- Command logic inscribed in pattern cycles—similar to written spells in motion.
- When the Weave around the construct destabilizes (anti-magic zones, divine interference), its behavior ceases or becomes erratic.

Divinatory Insight: Constructs emit constant resonance. Their Weave signature lacks emotional flux, appearing as a perfectly harmonic pulse—a “dead pattern of precision.”

# Limitations and Dangers

- Constructs cannot heal; damage to the matrix weakens the binding permanently.
- Overloading or corrupting the energy core may cause a mana cascade—a burst of raw Weave energy that can level structures.
- Soul-anchored constructs often experience identity instability, mimicking their donor’s final emotions.

# Philosophical Notes

- Constructs represent control without life, the perfect opposite of undeath (which is life without control).
- They are the purest reflection of arcane will—existence reduced to function.
- Some theorists in the Academy suggest the Weave itself resists self-sustaining constructs, as if magic rejects imitation of creation.

Note: “A construct obeys perfectly, and so can never understand. Perfection, in the Weave, is stagnation.”

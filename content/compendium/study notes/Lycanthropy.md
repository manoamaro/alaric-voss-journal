# Classification

_Transmutative-Curse Hybrid._

A magical affliction blending transmutation, primal influence, and cursecraft. Transforms humanoids into bestial forms tied to specific predators—wolves, bears, boars, tigers, or rats.

# Nature of the Curse

Lycanthropy is transmitted through a bite or claw wound from an afflicted creature. The curse embeds itself in the victim’s blood and soul, rewriting the Weave’s pattern of self.

The condition does not merely imitate beasts—it fuses mortal and animal instincts into a single unstable identity.

# Types

- Werewolf — most common; feral, territorial, and organized in hidden packs.
- Werebear — rare; often benevolent or protective, resisting the curse’s rage.
- Wererat — secretive; spread through cities, favor subterfuge over violence.
- Weretiger — solitary hunters; calm but lethal when provoked.
- Wereboar — brutish, aggressive, driven by dominance instinct.

Each strain aligns with a unique primal signature in the Weave, suggesting origin from ancient druidic experiments or curses laid by nature spirits.

# Transmission and Resistance

- Transmitted through injury; curse manifests at the next full moon.
- Magical healing before the first transformation may prevent infection.
- Shapechangers or divine-blooded individuals (Aasimar, Shifters, some Elves) show partial resistance.

# Behavioral Effects

- Heightened senses and aggression.
- Partial memory loss during transformation.
- Growing struggle between human reason and primal instinct.
- Some learn control, others succumb fully to the beast.

# Cure and Control

- Remove Curse before the first voluntary transformation restores humanity.
- After acceptance of the beast form, only divine intervention (Wish, True Resurrection) can break it.
- Controlled lycanthropes retain their alignment only through strong will or faith.
- Moonlight triggers transformations; certain magical wards can suppress it temporarily.

# Divinatory Observations

- The Weave around a lycanthrope pulses irregularly—oscillating between two harmonic states (mortal and beast).
- Prediction spells become unreliable near them; outcomes shift based on instinct rather than intent.
- Their fate threads appear “twined,” reflecting dual essence.

# Philosophical Notes

- Lycanthropy is not undeath but imbalance: life in conflict with its own nature. 
- Unlike [[compendium/study notes/Vampiric Entities\|vampires]], lycanthropes belong to the natural order, though twisted by curse.
- The beast is neither purely evil nor good—it is freedom without conscience.

# Summary Thought

“_Lycanthropy is not a theft of life but a fracture of self. Where a [[compendium/study notes/Vampiric Entities\|vampire]] defies death, a lycanthrope defies identity.”_

Undead of the Second Order — retain intellect, emotion, and will. Not reanimated corpses but sustained by negative energy.

## Creation

Result of a necromantic transformation, often through another vampire’s bite followed by death.

### Origin theories

- Failed immortality ritual (Narfell).
- Divine punishment (Lathander’s clergy).
- “Weave fracture” — severed soul still bound to flesh (Academy view).

## Core Traits

- Immortal, unaging.
- Rapid regeneration unless exposed to sunlight, holy power, or running water.
- Cannot enter a home uninvited.
- No reflection or shadow (symbol of severed soul).
- Must feed on blood to maintain stability.

## Abilities

- Command or dominate minds (true psychic tether).
- Transform into mist, bat, or wolf forms.
- Strong charm aura; influence extends beyond simple hypnosis.

## Weaknesses

- Sunlight burns and weakens.
- Running water causes damage or disintegration.
- Holy symbols and radiant energy suppress regeneration.
- Wooden stake through the heart disrupts the necromantic bond.

## Divinatory Observations

- Presence disrupts scrying; subjects sometimes “see” the observer.
- Fate around vampires collapses into singular outcomes (“Convergence Principle”).
- Threads of the Weave resist their existence but cannot fully reject it.

## Philosophical Notes

- Existence without growth; the Weave flows around them, not through them.
- Proof of consciousness divorced from mortality—unnatural equilibrium.
- They represent rebellion against death and distortion of destiny.

## Summary Thought

Vampires are not merely predators of flesh but fractures in the pattern of fate. They feed on life to hold together what the Weave has already tried to erase.

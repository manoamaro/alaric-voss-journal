_Mentor of Alaric Voss, High Diviner of the Neverwinter Academy_

![[media/alaric_voss_kale.jpg|500]]

Kale Thandrel is a human archmage of formidable intellect and cold precision, a figure both revered and quietly feared within the [[compendium/locations/Neverwinter Academy]]. Born over a century ago, sustained by the slow decay of arcane longevity, he is the current High Diviner and custodian of the Selenic Codex—a forbidden compendium of predictive and retrocausal magic.

His demeanor is calm, almost surgical. He teaches that divination is not about glimpsing futures for comfort but dissecting the Weave to expose inevitability itself. He often says: “To know is to interfere. Every observation is a distortion. Remember that before you look too deep.”

When Alaric studied under him, Kale recognized the young wizard’s rare sensitivity to omens—a resonance he described as “the mind’s alignment with the Weave’s pulse.” He took Alaric as a personal apprentice, guiding him through advanced divinatory formulas and experimental prediction models that were rarely permitted to apprentices. Under Kale’s tutelage, Alaric developed the theory that became his thesis: “Threads of the Unseen: A Theoretical Framework for Predictive Weaving through Controlled Divinatory Resonance.”

Kale’s mentorship, however, was not entirely benevolent. Though he pushed Alaric to mastery, he also warned him never to peer too far into “closed futures”—events sealed by powerful will or divine interference. The Archmage himself had done so once and bore the cost in his eyes, which flicker faintly like glass reflecting unseen stars whenever he gazes into darkness. Rumors among senior students whisper that Kale’s sight extends beyond the mortal plane, and that he no longer dreams as humans do.

When Alaric came to him after the nightmare—the castle, the figure without reflection, the red light—Kale’s reaction was uncharacteristically emotional. He dismissed the vision as dangerous and forbidden, his tone sharp with something between fear and regret. His warning, “Some truths should remain unknown—for your sake, and for ours,” was the only time Alaric saw his composure break.

That night, after much hesitation, Kale gave Alaric a ritual from the Selenic Codex. It was not permission but a test—a measure of whether his student would obey or pursue truth regardless of consequence. In Alaric’s defiance, Kale saw both promise and doom.

In the Academy’s archives, Kale Thandrel is officially recorded as still serving as High Diviner, but several students claim his chambers have been sealed for weeks, the door marked with the sigil of the Eye Closed in Shadow—a sign used only when a seer is lost between timelines. Whether Kale remains alive, trapped in foresight, or gone beyond the veil of the Weave is unknown.

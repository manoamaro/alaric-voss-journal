- **Origin:** Humanoid descendants of dragons, created through ancient draconic magic or divine design by dragon gods such as Bahamut and Tiamat. Unlike half-dragons, they are a distinct race, not hybrids.
- **Appearance:** Tall and muscular (6–7 feet), covered in fine scales. Possess reptilian features—muzzle-like faces, clawed hands, and powerful tails (in some lineages). Scale colors reflect draconic ancestry: red, gold, silver, blue, etc.
- **Culture:** Honor-bound and proud, valuing discipline, self-mastery, and reputation. Many live by codes of conduct derived from draconic ideals—order, strength, and destiny.
- **Temperament:** Intensely driven. Their sense of personal honor and responsibility is central to their identity. Dishonor or failure is felt as a personal stain.
- **Abilities:** Natural breath weapon aligned to their scale color (fire, lightning, acid, cold, or poison). Resistant to the same energy type.
- **Faith:** Often divided between **Bahamut** (justice, nobility, protection) and **Tiamat** (power, ambition, domination). Some reject both, seeking personal enlightenment through the Dragonborn ideal of _self as legacy_.

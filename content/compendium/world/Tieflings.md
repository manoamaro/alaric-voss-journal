- **Origin:** Descendants of mortals whose bloodlines were touched by infernal or fiendish power—typically through ancient pacts, curses, or planar exposure. The taint endures across generations. 
- **Appearance:** Humanoid, often with horns, tails, pointed teeth, and eyes of solid color (red, gold, or violet). Skin tones range from human hues to deep crimson, blue, or purple.
- **Temperament:** Often introspective or defiant. Many struggle with prejudice or superstition from others, shaping strong self-reliance.
- **Culture:** No single homeland. Tieflings integrate into other societies or form enclaves where acceptance exists. Their culture is built more on shared experience than heritage.
- **Abilities:** Natural affinity for arcane energy and resistance to fire; many possess minor innate spell-like talents.
- **Faith:** Divided—some seek redemption through lawful or good deities, others reject gods entirely, believing their bloodline has already defined their fate.

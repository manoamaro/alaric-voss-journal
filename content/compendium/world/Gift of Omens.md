Gift of Omens is the manifestation of Savras’s favor—an intuitive awareness of fate’s subtle currents.

# Nature

It appears as flashes of pattern recognition that others dismiss: a flicker in candlelight, a misplaced stone, a dream fragment. For Alaric, these signals form a quiet language of probability and destiny.

# In practice

- He senses when events hinge on unseen variables.
- Coincidences draw his focus; he reads them as data from the divine.
- Divination magic amplifies the signal, but even without it, he feels echoes of outcomes before they unfold.

# Visual or narrative cues

When the Gift manifests, the world stills. Sounds dull. Light refracts subtly. Alaric’s pupils constrict as if measuring invisible geometry.

# Belief

He interprets this not as prophecy but as access to the ordered design Savras perceives. The Gift of Omens is not control—it is comprehension, fleeting and incomplete, of the equation that binds all cause and effect.

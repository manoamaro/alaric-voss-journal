# Nature

Savras represents structure within prophecy. He sees all outcomes but rarely intervenes, valuing accuracy over mercy. His followers view reality as a grand equation of cause and effect, with divine sight as the means to read it.

# Dogma

- Seek truth in all things.
- Use divination responsibly.
- Knowledge is sacred only when shared in order.
- Fate can be read but not rewritten.

# Worship

Temples are few. Shrines often appear in libraries, observatories, and wizard towers. Worshippers include diviners, oracles, astrologers, and judges who prize truth over comfort.

# Relations

He once warred with Azuth, god of wizards, but was later reconciled under Mystra’s rule. Savras now serves as her seer, guarding secrets of time and destiny.

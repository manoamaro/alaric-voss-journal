**The Morninglord** is the dominant faith in Barovia and a major sun-aligned religion throughout parts of Faerûn. In the wider Realms he is known as **Lathander**, but in Barovia his worship has eroded, distorted, or faded into half-remembered fragments.

# **Core Concepts:**

- Source of renewal, hope, dawn, and rebirth.
- Light as both mercy and judgment.
- Every sunrise symbolizes a new chance to break cycles of darkness.

# \*_Beliefs in Faerûn:_

- Lathander is the god of creativity, youth, beginnings, self-improvement, and righteous action.
- Clergy preach optimism, discipline, and striving for a better world.
- Temples are bright, clean, filled with music and art.
- Followers include artisans, paladins, farmers, and reformers.

# **Beliefs in Barovia (degraded form)**

- The sun almost never rises fully; faith has dimmed.
- The Morninglord is still worshipped but feels distant. Many Barovians doubt he hears their prayers.
- Teachings revolve around endurance rather than hope: keep the candle lit, even if dawn never comes.
- Rituals include soft candlelight, whispered prayers before dawn, and pleas for protection from the night.

# **Symbols**

- Faerûn: a stylized sunburst of reds and golds.
- Barovia: simplified—often a crudely carved sunrise, faded and colorless.

# **Priests (like [[compendium/characters/Father Donovich]])**

- Expected to embody compassion and perseverance.
- Maintain sanctuaries, offer blessings against undeath, and serve as the last bastions of moral order.
- In Barovia, priests are often broken by endless failure, clinging to faith out of desperation rather than conviction.

# **Magic and Themes**

- Spells emphasize radiant light, healing, purification, and banishment of undead.
- Followers believe every act of kindness is a spark against the darkness.

For Alaric, the Morninglord’s religion appears like a flickering remnant — a faith built around a sunrise that never comes, yet still stubbornly held by those who refuse to surrender to Strahd’s night.
